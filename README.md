# EN1Course
 A "Getting Started" for LabVIEW 2019

Welcome to our simple attempt at reducing barriers to entry for first time users of LabVIEW.  We will be testing this in the EN1 class this fall (2019).  Any feedback is welcome (crogers@tufts.edu).

1. Download the files, unzip and place in your Project folder (a) Mac users - Applications:National Instruments:LabVIEW 2019:Project (b) PC users - Program Files (x86)/National Instruments/LabVIEW 2019/Project
2. start LabVIEW
3. go to the Tools Menu and select the new Menu Item EN1Course to check things out.  We will be adding to this collection as we need them in class.
